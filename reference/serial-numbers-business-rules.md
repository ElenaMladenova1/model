# Serial Numbers Business Rules

The serial number is indicated in the document lines and it could be selected from a drop-down list. The value could be manually changed by the user. In order to make sure that the right serial number correctly set, we need to make certain validations. The description of the validations is specified in the table below. Those validations are executed separately for different documents at various events. For more information, please check the 'Business Rules' section for the particular document.
