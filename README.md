# Welcome to the ERP.net Data Model Reference

The documentation uses a custom, internal ERP.net version of DocFX to build:
https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/docfx

The entities, attributes and front-end business rules are managed automatically from internal entity meta-data.
There is a build each night, which updates the entity topics with the latest changes.

> The model includes the very latest updates from the night builds.
>
> Some attributes might not exist in your current version of ERP.net.

The business rules and generation procedures are added manually.
