If the customer has no enterprise company, then it is considered that this customer is valid customer to all enterprise companies in the database and this is a valid SalesOrder. The idea of this business rule is to prevent the user to make Sales Orders to a customer which is not registered as such in the current enterprise company. When registering a customer, the user enters sales terms which the company will apply with the specified customer.

    "title": "Data Types | ERP.net Domain Model",
    "keywords": "Data Types MultilanguageString Some text properties support value in more than one language. This properties are of multi-language string type. The multi-language string can store many language strings, indexing them by language key. The language key is a CultureInfo two letter ISO language name, like \"en\", \"de\", etc. For example, the name of a product is a data attribute, which can simultaneously contain translation of the product name in many languages. When you retrieve the value of this attribute with the Domain API, you get values similar to: { \"en\": \"Apple\", \"de\": \"Apfel\" } All translations are a single value All translations in a multi-language string are treated as a single value. You cannot change only one language pair - all pairs are updated simultaneously. The client applications are responsible for managing all language pairs. Filtering The equality comparison for multi-language string is ambiguous. The APIs generally do not support direct equality comparisons. Note Domain API supports only the filter function contains . For example, in Domain API, the following is supported: ~/General_Products_Products?$filter=contains(Name,'ppl') However, this is not valid: ~/General_Products_Products?$filter=Name eq 'Apple' Amount The ERP domain model declares a special type for amount (currency) properties. The amount is represented by value and currency. Properties Name Type Description Currency String The currency of the amount represented by it's sign. Value Decimal The value of the amount. Domain API Example: { \"LineAmount\": { \"Value\": \"3.55\", \"Currency\": \"USD\" } } Quantity The ERP domain model declares a special type for quantity properties. The quantity is represented by value and measurement unit. Properties Name Type Description Unit String TThe measurement unit of the quantity represented by it's code. Value Decimal The value of the quantity. Domain API Example: { \"LineAmount\": { \"Value\": \"5.555\", \"Unit\": \"PCS\" } } CustomPropertyValue User-defined properties, which can supplement the system properties of almost all entities in the system. Custom properties are defined in General_CustomProperties entity. EntityName specifies the entity for which the property is applicable. Table of EntityName -> REST API Resource Name corespondences Custom properties can be free text property or restricted to a list of allowed values. This is specified by LimitToAllowedValues property. AllowedValuesEntityName specifies that the allowed values are retrieved from the specified entity. If null the allowed values are retrieved from General_CustomPropertyAllowedValues In EnterpriseOne REST API custom properties are properties of type General_CustomPropertyValue. The API name of the custom property starts with 'CustomProperty_' followed by the user defined property code. Each database contains different custom properties and that is why each database have different EDM model ($metadata). Properties Name Type Description Value String The short value Description MultilanguageString The description of the property value.Can be null. ValueId guid The Id of the entry represented by the property value. It's the id of the allowed value. Can be null. Domain API Example: \"CustomProperty_color\": { \"Value\": \"Apple\", \"ValueId\": \"5263a2d3-88b0-41db-adae-31c76135719e\", \"Description\": { \"en\": \"Apple\", \"de\": \"Apfel\" } }"

Return Type : void Declaring Type : Documents Domain API Request : POST Parameters reason The reason for voiding the document. Type : string voidType The type of void operation to execute. Type : General.DocumentsRepositoryBase.VoidType Specifies the type of void operation Allowed Values (General.DocumentsRepositoryBase.VoidType Enum Members) Value Description VoidDocument Void only the document. If there are sub-documents, the operation might fail. Model Value: 0 Domain API Value: 'VoidDocument' VoidWithSubDocuments Void the document and its non-released sub-documents. If there are released sub-documents, the operation might fail. Model Value: 1 Domain API Value: 'VoidWithSubDocuments' VoidWithReleased SubDocuments Void the document and all of its sub-documents, even the released ones. Model Value: 2 Domain API Value: 'VoidWithReleased SubDocuments' Optional : True Default Value : VoidDocument GetPrintout Gets a document printout as a file. The returned value is Base64 string representation of the file contents. Return Type : string Declaring Type : Documents Domain API Request : POST Parameters fileFormat The file format: pdf, html, xlsx, xls, docx, txt and png. The default format is 'pdf'. Type : string Optional : True Default Value : pdf printout The printout defined for the document type of the document. If null the default printout of the document type is used. Type : Printouts Optional : True Default Value : null Recalculate The document and all of its owned objects will be altered to become valid. Return Type : void Declaring Type : Documents Domain API Request : POST In some cases the objects in child collection of the document depend on values from other child objects. This method ensures that all child objects are properly validated. The changes are only in memory and are not committed to the server.
