| Description | The field Standard Quantity contains the equivalence of the Quantity calculated in base measurement unit. Although small variations between both values are possible due to ordered/executed exhaustion, big differences could mean that the quantities are not properly filled in or updated. <br/>For this reason, the current rule validates that the difference between Standard Quantity and the Quantity calculated in base measurement unit is not bigger that 0.999.|
| Message | The field 'Standard Quantity' in '{WarehouseTransaction.DisplayText}' contains an invalid value. <br/> The 'Standard Quantity' field should contain the equivalence of the 'Quantity' calculated in base measurement unit according to the product's measurement ratios. <br/> Please check if the values in both fields are correct.|
