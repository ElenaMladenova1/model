# R28170 Lot - Valid Lot
The lots are indicated in the document lines and could be selected from a drop-down list. The value could be manually
changed by the user. In order to make sure that the right lot is selected, we need to make certain validations. The
description of the validation is specified in the table below.Â This validation is executed at the Planning + event of
different documents. Currently, the following documents contain lots in their lines:

-   Sales Order

-   Shipment Order

-   Shipment

-   Store Order

-   Store Transaction

-   Reconciliation

-   Transfer Order

-   Requisition

-   Purchase Order

-   Receiving Order

-   Work Order - in both in Work Order Items table and Ingredients table

-   Consumption Order

-   Output Order

This is the validation:

| **Action**     | Validate that:                                                                                      |
|                |                                                                                                     |
|                | If (DocumetLine.Lot != null)                                                                        |
|                |                                                                                                     |
|                | Product == Lot.Product                                                                              |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *              | As different lots may have the same name/number, it is possible the user to select incorrect lot    |
| *Description** | (for examples - if the he selects the lot from a navigator) and this lot may be defined for         |
|                | different product. The current validation rises from that as the traceability of such operative     |
|                | error may be difficult.                                                                             |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Message**    | Lot {Lot} is defined for a product different than the one selected in the row - {Product}.          |
|                |                                                                                                     |
