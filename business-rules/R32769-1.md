| Description | This rule deletes unused ContactMechanism for new records when PartyContactMechanism is deleted before commit. |
| Message | - |
| Introduced In Version | Introduced: 2022 <br/> Removed - version: 24 <br/> Removed - reason: The rule interfered with legacy external apps, creating party contact mechanisms in two phases (instead of the suggested one-step creation). Although one-step creation is strongly recommended, two-step creation is now fully supported and the rule is no longer necessary.|
| Revocable | YES |
