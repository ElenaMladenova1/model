| **Description**    | The same Asset can't be rented twice for the same period of time. For this reason, each line of |
|                    | the particular Lease Contract is validated, that the Rental Asset has not already been rented   |
|                    | with another line (including the lines of the current document).                                |
|                    |                                                                                                 |
|                    | A Rental Asset is considered as rented if:                                                      |
|                    |                                                                                                 |
|                    | - it is used in a Lease Contract with a Document State Released, Completed or Closed that is    |
|                    | not Voided;                                                                                     |

|                    | - the Leasing Period of the line overlaps with the Leasing Period of the current                |
|                    | LeaseContractLine.                                                                              |

|                    | The Leasing Period is determined by the Transaction Timestamps of the rental Transaction with   |
|                    | which it has been delivered or received. If for the particular Rental Asset there are no rental |
|                    | Transactions, then the start and end date of this period are determined by the Start and End    |
|                    | Date set in the Lease Contract Lines.                                                           |
