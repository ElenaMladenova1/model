| Action                  | Validate that: For each line in the document the StartNumber and EndNumber are smaller than StartNumber in every line in the already existing documents with same combination of Excise Stamp Lot and Excise Stamp Operation Type, or StartNumber and EndNumber are greater than any EndNumber for the same reference line.<br />**(New.StartNumber < Exist.StartNumber and New.EndNumber<Exist.StartNumber) OR (StartNumber>Exist.EndNumber and EndNumber>Exist.EndNumber) <br />WhereExciseStampLot and ExciseStampOperationType  are the same as in the current line and document and the referenced document has Released+ status.** |
| Description             | For each line in the document, it is checked whether the Excise Stamp numbers between the fields "From Number" and "To Number" have been used in other "Excise Stamp Operations" with a status of Released or higher for the same combination of Excise Stamp Lot and Excise Stamp Operation Type. |
| Message                 | The series starting with '{ExciseStampOperationLine.StartNumber}' and ending with '{ExciseStampOperationLine.EndNumber}' overlaps with an already entered Excise Stamp Operation for the same Excise Stamp Lot and Excise Stamp Operation Type. The conflicting document is '{ExciseStampOperationLine}' with a Start Number of '{ExciseStampOperationLine.StartNumber}' and an End Number of '{ExciseStampOperationLine.EndNumber}'. |
