##  Business Logic

The current generation procedure is used to create Payment Transactions from Payment Orders. 
It is used in cases when the execution of the orders is not performed by a user through a specialized navigator, but instead should be done automatically when generating or changing the document state of the Payment Order.

> [!Note]
> A new Payment Transaction is generated then and only when the remaining amount of the metric "MTotalAmount" is different from 0.

**The Payment Transaction’s header is created based on the Payment Order’s header as follows:**

```
PaymentTransaction.Notes = PaymentOrder.Notes PaymentTransaction.Party = PaymentOrder.Party PaymentTransaction.PaymentType = PaymentOrder.PaymentType PaymentTransaction.PaymentAccount = PaymentOrder.PaymentAccount PaymentTransaction.TotalAmountCurrency = PaymentOrder.TotalAmountCurrency PaymentTransaction.RequiresAllocation = true PaymentTransaction.Direction = PaymentOrder.Direction PaymentTransaction.PaymentReason = system payment reason for party payment
```

## Fulfillments

| Name                        | PaymentOrderToPaymentTransactionLine                         |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity               | Payment Order                                                |
| Child Entity                | Payment Transaction Line                                     |
| Parent / Child Relationship | PaymentTransactionPaymentTransactionLine.PaymentOrder = PaymentOrder |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name                     | Metric Name  |         Measurement Unit         | Parent Value             | Child Value                                                 | New Record |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------: | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| PaymentOrderToPaymentTransactionLine | MTotalAmount | PaymentOrder.TotalAmountCurrency | PaymentOrder.TotalAmount | PaymentTransactionPaymentTransactionLine.CoveredOrderAmount | YES        |

In the new document is created only one Payment Transaction Line:

```
PaymentTransactionLine.CoveredOrderAmount = PaymentOrder.REMAINING(MTotalAmount) PaymentTransactionLine.PaymentOrder = PaymentOrder
```
