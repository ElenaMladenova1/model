## Business Logic

This Generation is used to create Excise Administrative Documents for the products of the current Store Transactions that have value for the field ExciseProductsType.
The Excise Administrative Document's header is created based on the Store Transaction's header as follows:

```
ExciseAdministrativeDocument.TaxWarehouse = StoreTransaction.Store.TaxWarehouse

ExciseAdministrativeDocument.OtherParty = StoreTransaction.ToParty

ExciseAdministrativeDocument.CurrencyDirectory = StoreTransaction.CurrencyDirectory
```

> [!Note] 
> The attributes which are not specified here are filled in as described in [Standard Document Attributes](../reference/standard-document-attributes.md)

> [!Note] 
> The new Excise Administrative Document is saved then and only when there is at least one line in it.

## Fulfillments

| Name                        | StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine       |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity               | StoreTransactionLine                                         |
| Child Entity                | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine                             |
| Parent / Child Relationship | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransaction; ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLineParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name                                       |  Metric Name  |                 Measurement Unit                 | Parent Value                      | Child Value                                   | New Record |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine | MQuantityBase | StoreTransactionLine.Product.BaseMeasurementUnit | StoreTransactionLine.QuantityBase | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityBase | YES        |
| StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine |   MQuantity   |        StoreTransactionLine.QuantityUnit         | StoreTransactionLine.Quantity     | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Quantity     | NO         |

The lines of the new document are created based on the data for the Fulfilled Part of quantities by ExciseAdministrativeDocument that are already created (for more information, see topic [Discrepancy System](../reference/discrepancy-system.md)). The new ExciseAdministrativeDocument is created as follows:

```
ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.LineNo = Autonumber

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransactionLine.TransactionObj

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Product = StoreTransactionLine.Product

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Quantity = StoreTransactionLine.REMAINING(MQuantity)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityUnit = StoreTransactionLine.QuantityUnit

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityBase = StoreTransactionLine.REMAINING(MQuantityBase)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseQuantityUnit = StoreTransactionLine.Product.ExciseProductType.MeasurementUnit

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseQuantity = Convert(QuantityBase, ExciseQuantityUnit)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.MeasuringTransaction = StoreTransactionLine.Lot.ExciseMeasuringTransaction


ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAlcoholicStrength = 
IF MeasuringTransaction is not Null THEN MeasuringTransaction.AlcoholDegree
IF MeasuringTransaction is Null THEN Product.ExciseProductType.AlcoholicStrength

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseProduct = StoreTransactionLine.Product.ExciseProductsType.ExciseProduct

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExcisePurposeCode = DefaultExcisePurposeCode

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseDutyRate = DetermineExciseDutyRate(ExciseProduct, ExcisePurposeCode, ExciseAdministrativeDocument.EnterpriseCompany.BaseCurrency)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseDutyRateValue = ExciseDutyRate.ExciseDutyRateField

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAmountBase = CalculateExciseAmountBase(ExciseProduct, ExciseQuantity, ExciseAlcoholicStrength)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAmount = ExciseAmountBase * ExciseDutyRateValue
```

###### Functions:

**DefaultExcisePurposeCode** - return this ExcisePurposeCode which has check "Is Default" in ExcisePurposeCodes table.

https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Excise.ExcisePurposeCodes.html

**DetermineExciseDutyRate (ExciseProduct, ExcisePurposeCode, Currency)** - return this ExciseDutyRate which has match with the two parameters ExciseProduct and ExcisePurposeCode in ExciseDutyRates table. 

https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Excise.ExciseDutyRates.html

**CalculateExciseAmountBase(ExciseProduct, QuantityBase, ExciseAlcoholicStrength)** - calculate ExciseAmountBase with ExciseProduct.ExciseProductCategory.CalculationAlgorithm and parameters Quantity Ð¸ ExciseAlcoholicStrength.
