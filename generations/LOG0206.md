## Business Logic

This Generation is used to create Excise Administrative Documents from Store Transactions. 

The Excise Administrative Document's header is created based on the Store Transaction's header as follows:

```
ExciseAdministrativeDocument.TaxWarehouse = StoreTransaction.Store.TaxWarehouse

ExciseAdministrativeDocument.OtherParty = StoreTransaction.ToParty

ExciseAdministrativeDocument.DocumentCurrency = StoreTransaction.DocumentCurrency

ExciseAdministrativeDocument.CurrencyDirectory = StoreTransaction.CurrencyDirectory
```

> [!Note] 
> The attributes which are not specified here are filled in as described in [Standard Document Attributes](../reference/standard-document-attributes.md)

> [!Note] 
> The new Excise Administrative Document is saved then and only when there is at least one line in it.

## Fulfillments

| Name                        | StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine       |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity               | StoreTransactionLine                                         |
| Child Entity                | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine                             |
| Parent / Child Relationship | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransaction; ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLineParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name                                       |  Metric Name  |                 Measurement Unit                 | Parent Value                      | Child Value                                   | New Record |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine | MQuantityBase | StoreTransactionLine.Product.BaseMeasurementUnit | StoreTransactionLine.QuantityBase | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityBase | YES        |
| StoreTransactionLineToExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine |   MQuantity   |        StoreTransactionLine.QuantityUnit         | StoreTransactionLine.Quantity     | ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Quantity     | NO         |

The lines of the new document are created based on the data for the Fulfilled Part of quantities by ExciseAdministrativeDocument that are already created (for more information, see topic [Discrepancy System](../reference/discrepancy-system.md)). The new ExciseAdministrativeDocument is created as follows:

```
ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.LineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransactionLine.TransactionObj

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Product = StoreTransactionLine.Product

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.Quantity = StoreTransactionLine.REMAINING(MQuantity)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityUnit = StoreTransactionLine.QuantityUnit

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.QuantityBase = StoreTransactionLine.REMAINING(MQuantityBase)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.MeasuringTransaction = StoreTransactionLine.Lot.ExciseMeasuringTransaction

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAlcoholicStrength = StoreTransactionLine.Product.ExciseAlcoholicStrength

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseProduct = StoreTransactionLine.Product.ExciseProduct

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExcisePurposeCode = DefaultExcisePurposeCode

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseDutyRate = DetermineExciseDutyRate(ExciseProduct, ExcisePurposeCode, Currency)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseDutyRateValue = Convert(ExciseDutyRate.ExciseDutyRateField, DocumentCurrency).

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAmountBase = CalculateExciseAmountBase(ExciseProduct, QuantityBase, ExciseAlcoholicStrength)

ExciseAdministrativeDocumentLine.ExciseAmount = QuantityBase * ExciseDutyRateValue
```

###### Functions:

**DefaultExcisePurposeCode** - return this ExcisePurposeCode which has check "Is Default" in ExcisePurposeCodes table.

https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Excise.ExcisePurposeCodes.html

**DetermineExciseDutyRate (ExciseProduct, ExcisePurposeCode, Currency)** - return this ExciseDutyRate which has match with the two parameters ExciseProduct and ExcisePurposeCode in ExciseDutyRates table. 

https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Excise.ExciseDutyRates.html

**Convert(ExciseDutyRate.ExciseDutyRateField, DocumentCurrency)**  - convert ExciseDutyRate.ExciseDutyRateField to DocumentCurrency.

**CalculateExciseAmountBase(ExciseProduct, QuantityBase, ExciseAlcoholicStrength)** - calculate ExciseAmountBase with ExciseProduct.ExciseProductCategory.CalculationAlgorithm and parameters Quantity Ð¸ ExciseAlcoholicStrength.
