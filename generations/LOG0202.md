This Generation Procedure is used to create Store Transactions from Store Orders (the Store Transactions are almost identical copies of the orders). They are used in cases when the execution of the orders is not performed by a user through a specialized navigator, but instead should be done automatically when generating or releasing the Store Order.

The "LOG0202 Create Unmanaged Store transaction" generation procedure's action and business are the same as the described for LOG02201 (for more information, see [LOG0201 Create Store transactions](LOG0201.md)). The only difference between the two procedures is that unlike "[LOG0201 Create Store transactions](LOG0201.md)" the execution of the current generation procedure does not depend on whether "Direct order execution" in the Storeâ€™s definition is check-marked or not. A sub-document is created even if Direct order execution is not allowed.
