##  Business Logic

The current generation creates Invoice directly from an already existing Invoice Order. The invoice is almost identical to the invoice order and the generation is used in cases when the invoicing is automatic and is nor not executed by the users through a specialized navigator.

The Invoice header is created based on the Invoice Order header as follows:

```
Invoice.DocumentDate = today

Invoice.Customer = InvoiceOrder.Customer

Invoice.Notes = InvoiceOrder.Notes

Invoice.DocumentCurrency = InvoiceOrder.DocumentCurrency

Invoice.PaymentType = InvoiceOrder.PaymentType

Invoice.PaymentTypeDescription = InvoiceOrder.PaymentTypeDescription

Invoice.PaymentAccount = InvoiceOrder.PaymentAccount

Invoice.PaymentDueDate = if InvoiceOrder.PaymentDueDate.HasValue

then MAX(InvoiceOrder.PaymentDueDate, InvoiceOrder.DocumentDate) + (today - InvoiceOrder.DocumentDate)

else empty

Invoice.CreditNoteOriginalInvoice = InvoiceOrder.CreditNoteOriginalInvoice

Invoice.CreditNoteDescription = InvoiceOrder.CreditNoteDescription

Invoice.DeliveryDate = if InvoiceOrder.DeliveryDate.HasValue,

​    then InvoiceOrder.DeliveryDate

​    else Invoice.DocumentDate

Invoice.DealType = InvoiceOrder.DealType

Invoice.ApplyDate = InvoiceOrder.ApplyDate

Invoice.PaymentDueStartDate = InvoiceOrder.PaymentDueStartDate
```

The rest of the Document table attributes which are not listed here are filled in as described in [Standard Document Attributes](https://confluence.erp.net/display/techdoc/Standard+Document+Attributes).

> [!Note]
> The new invoice is saved then and only when there is at least one line in it.

## Fulfillments

| Name                        | InvoiceOrderLineToInvoiceLine                                |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity               | InvoiceOrderLine                                             |
| Child Entity                | InvoiceLine                                                  |
| Parent / Child Relationship | InvoiceLine.ParentDocument = InvoiceOrder;InvoiceLine.ParentLineNo = InvoiceOrderLine.LineNo |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name              |      Metric Name      |               Measurement Unit               | Parent Value                          | Child Value                       | New Record |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------: | :------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :--------- |
| InvoiceOrderLineToInvoiceLine | MStandardQuantityBase | InvoiceOrderLine.Product.BaseMeasurementUnit | InvoiceOrderLine.StandardQuantityBase | iInvoiceLine.StandardQuantityBase | YES        |
| InvoiceOrderLineToInvoiceLine |       MQuantity       |        InvoiceOrderLine.QuantityUnit         | InvoiceOrderLine.Quantity             | InvoiceLine.Quantity              | NO         |
| InvoiceOrderLineToInvoiceLine |     MQuantityBase     | InvoiceOrderLine.Product.BaseMeasurementUnit | InvoiceOrderLine.QuantityBase         | InvoiceLine.QuantityBase          | NO         |
| InvoiceOrderLineToInvoiceLine |      MLineAmount      |        InvoiceOrder.DocumentCurrency         | InvoiceOrderLine.LineAmount           | InvoiceLine.LineAmount            | YES        |

The lines of the new document are created based on the data for the Fulfilled Part of quantities and amounts by Invoices that are already created (for more information, see topic [Discrepancy System](https://enterpriseone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/techdoc/pages/22380546/Discrepancy+System)).
The new InvoiceLine is created as follows:

```
InvoiceLine.LineNo = InvoiceOrderLine.LineNo
InvoiceLine.Product = InvoiceOrderLine.Product
InvoiceLine.ProductDescription = InvoiceOrderLine.ProductDescription
InvoiceLine.Quantity = InvoiceOrderLine.REMAINING(MQuantity)
InvoiceLine.QuantityUnit = InvoiceOrderLine.QuantityUnit
InvoiceLine.LineDiscount = InvoiceOrderLine.LineDiscount
InvoiceLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent = InvoiceOrderLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent
InvoiceLine.LineCustomDiscountPercent = InvoiceOrderLine.LineCustomDiscountPercent
InvoiceLine.LineAmount = InvoiceOrderLine.REMAINING(MLineAmount)
InvoiceLine.ParentSalesOrderLine = InvoiceOrderLine.SalesOrderLine
InvoiceLine.LineDealType = InvoiceOrderLine.LineDealType
InvoiceLine.InvoiceOrderLine = InvoiceOrderLine
InvoiceLine.BusinessReason = InvoiceOrderLine.BusinessReason
InvoiceLine.SalesOrder = InvoiceOrderLine.SalesOrder
InvoiceLine.PaymentTransaction = InvoiceOrderLine.PaymentTransaction
InvoiceLine.TransactionLine = InvoiceOrderLine.TransactionLine
InvoiceLine.QuantityBase = InvoiceOrderLine.REMAINING(MQuantityBase)
InvoiceLine.StandardQuantityBase = InvoiceOrderLine.REMAINING(MStandardQuantityBase)
if InvoiceOrderLine.SalesOrderLine.HasValue then
    InvoiceLine.SalesOrderAmount = InvoiceOrderLine.REMAINING(MLineAmount)
InvoiceLine.SerialNumber = InvoiceOrderLine.SerialNumber
InvoiceLine.ParentLineNo = InvoiceOrderLine.LineNo
```
