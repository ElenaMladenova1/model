## Business Logic

The current generation procedure is meant to create template offers from a Deal.

To create an offer, the customer has to be specified. The customer is extracted from the party, selected in the Deal - Deal.Party - and the up to date customer definition of this party in the enterprise company of the offer - Offer.EnterpriseCompany(so Customer.Party = Deal.Party && Customer.EnterpriseCompany == Offer.EnterpriseCompany). If no such customer is found, the generation procedure is stopped and an error is thrown. The error text is:

> Party '{Deal.Party.PartyName}' is not defined as customer for enterprise company '{Deal.EnterpriseCompany.Party.PartyName}'. In order to create an offer the party has to be defined as customer for enterprise company '{Deal.EnterpriseCompany.Party.PartyName}'.

**The rest of the fields in the Offer’s header are filled as follows:**

```
Offer.Customer = Customer 
Offer.DocumentCurrency = Offer.EnterpriseCompany.BaseCurrency 
Offer.Deal = Deal 
Offer.SalesPerson = Deal.LeadingSalesPerson
```

The offer attributes RequiredDeliveryDate and PaymentDueDate are calculated by the data in the customer definition compared to the DocumentDate as follows:

- RequiredDeliveryDate = DocumentDate + Customer.DefaultDeliveryTermDays
- PaymentDueDate = DocumentDate + Customer.DefaultPaymentTermDays

The attributes PriceList and PaymentType are copied from the customer definition. If in the customer definition they are empty, they are empty in the offer too.

The Document table attributes:

```
Offer.DocumentDate = Deal.DocumentDate
* the attributes which are not specified here are filled in as described in Standard Document Attributes
```



The custom properties are copied to the offer only if they are defined in the offer document type.

## Fulfillments

No fulfilments and metrics are used for the current generation procedure. Each time the procedure is started, it creates new sub-document no matter if there are documents already created from previous procedure executions.

**The new Offer Line is created as follows:**

```
OfferLine.LineNo = DealLine.LineNo

OfferLine.Product = DealLine.Product

OfferLine.ProductDescription = OfferLine.Product.Name

OfferLine.GuaranteePeriodDays = OfferLine.Product.GuaranteePeriodDays

OfferLine.ProductCode = NULL

OfferLine.ProductPrice = loaded from [the determined Method](xref:determine-product-price)

OfferLine.UnitPrice = loaded from the determined Method https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/crm-common/crm-common-concepts/determine-product-price.html
If the Method didn’t find any record, then get OfferLine.Product.StandardPricePerLot

OfferLine.Quantity = DealLine.Quantity

OfferLine.QuantityUnit = DealLine.QuantityUnit

OfferLine.QuantityBase = CONVERT(OfferLine.Quantity, OfferLine.Product.BaseMeasurementCategory.BaseUnit)

OfferLine.StandardQuantityBase = CONVERT(OfferLine.Quantity, OfferLine.Product.BaseMeasurementCategory.BaseUnit)

OfferLine.LineDiscount = loaded by the determined Method https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/crm-common/crm-common-concepts/determine-line-discount.html

OfferLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent = loaded by the determined Method https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/crm-common/crm-common-concepts/determine-line-discount.html

OfferLine.LineCustomDiscountPercent = NULL

OfferLine.LineAmount = loaded by the determined Method https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/sales/sales-concepts/determine-line-amount-in-sales-orders.html 

OfferLine.LineEndCustomerParty = NULL

OfferLine.RequiredDeliveryDate = Offer.RequiredDeliveryDate

OfferLine.DeliveryTermDays = NULL

OfferLine.Variant = NULL

OfferLine.ChoiceGroupName = NULL

OfferLine.Notes = DealLine.Notes

OfferLine.IsSelected = true
```
