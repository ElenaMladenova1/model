## Business Logic

The current generation procedure is meant to create template offers from a Deal.

To create an offer, the customer has to be specified. The customer is extracted from the party, selected in the Deal - Deal.Party - and the up to date customer definition of this party in the enterprise company of the offer - Offer.EnterpriseCompany(so Customer.Party = Deal.Party && Customer.EnterpriseCompany == Offer.EnterpriseCompany). 
If no such customer is found, the generation procedure is stopped and an error is thrown. The error text is:

```
 Party '{Deal.Party.PartyName}' is not defined as customer for enterprise company '{Deal.EnterpriseCompany.Party.PartyName}'. 
 In order to create an offer the party has to be defined as customer for enterprise company '{Deal.EnterpriseCompany.Party.PartyName}'.
 ```

**The rest of the fields in the Offerâ€™s header are filled as follows:**

```
Offer.DocumentDate = Deal.DocumentDate
Offer.Customer = the determined Customer for the Deal.Party
Offer.DocumentCurrency = Offer.EnterpriseCompany.BaseCurrency 
Offer.Deal = Deal 
Offer.SalesPerson = Deal.LeadingSalesPerson
Offer.RequiredDeliveryDate = DocumentDate + Customer.DefaultDeliveryTermDays
Offer.PaymentDueDate = DocumentDate + Customer.DefaultPaymentTermDays
Offer.PriceList = Customer.DefaultPriceList
Offer.PaymentType = Customer.DefaultPaymentType
```

## Fulfillments

No fulfilments and metrics are used for the current generation procedure. Each time the procedure is started, it creates new sub-document no matter if there are documents already created from previous procedure executions.

**The new Offer Line is created as follows:**

```
OfferLine.LineNo = DealLine.LineNo

OfferLine.Product = DealLine.Product

OfferLine.ProductDescription = OfferLine.Product.Name

OfferLine.GuaranteePeriodDays = OfferLine.Product.GuaranteePeriodDays

OfferLine.ProductCode = NULL

OfferLine.ProductPrice = loaded by the 'Determine product price'* method

OfferLine.UnitPrice = if (OfferLine.ProductPrice != null) 
                      , then OfferLine.UnitPrice = OfferLine.ProductPrice.Price
                      , else OfferLine.UnitPrice = OfferLine.Product.StandardPricePerLot

OfferLine.Quantity = DealLine.Quantity

OfferLine.QuantityUnit = DealLine.QuantityUnit

OfferLine.QuantityBase = CONVERT(OfferLine.Quantity, OfferLine.Product.BaseMeasurementCategory.BaseUnit)

OfferLine.StandardQuantityBase = CONVERT(OfferLine.Quantity, OfferLine.Product.BaseMeasurementCategory.BaseUnit)

OfferLine.LineDiscount = loaded by the 'Determine line discount'* method

OfferLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent = if (OfferLine.LineDiscount != null)
                                        , then OfferLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent = OfferLine.LineDiscount.DiscountPercent
                                        , else OfferLine.LineStandardDiscountPercent = 0.00%   

OfferLine.LineCustomDiscountPercent = 0.00%

OfferLine.LineAmount = loaded by the 'Determine line amount in sales orders'* method

OfferLine.LineEndCustomerParty = NULL

OfferLine.RequiredDeliveryDate = Offer.RequiredDeliveryDate

OfferLine.DeliveryTermDays = 0

OfferLine.Variant = NULL

OfferLine.ChoiceGroupName = NULL

OfferLine.Notes = DealLine.Notes

OfferLine.IsSelected = true
