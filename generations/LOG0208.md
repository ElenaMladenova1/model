## Business Logic

This Generation is used to create Excise Stamp Operation from Store Transactions for the products that have value in the field ExciseProductType. 

The Excise Stamp Operation's header is created based on the Store Transaction's header as follows:

```
ExciseStampOperation.DocumentDate = StoreOrder.DocumentDate
ExciseStampOperation.TaxWarehouse = StoreTransaction.Store.TaxWarehouse

```

> [!Note] 
> The attributes which are not specified here are filled in as described in [Standard Document Attributes](../reference/standard-document-attributes.md)

> [!Note] 
> The new Excise Stamp Operation is saved then and only when there is at least one line in it.

## Fulfillments

| Name                        | StoreTransactionLineToExciseStampOperationLine               |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity               | StoreTransactionLine                                         |
| Child Entity                | ExciseStampOperationLine                                     |
| Parent / Child Relationship | ExciseStampOperationLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransaction; ExciseStampOperationLineParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name                               | Metric Name |         Measurement Unit          | Parent Value                  | Child Value                   | New Record |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :---------: | :-------------------------------: | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------- |
| StoreTransactionLineToExciseStampOperationLine |  MQuantity  | StoreTransactionLine.QuantityUnit | StoreTransactionLine.Quantity | ExciseStampOperation.Quantity | YES        |

The lines of the new document are created based on the data for the Fulfilled Part of quantities by ExciseStampOperation that are already created (for more information, see topic [Discrepancy System](../reference/discrepancy-system.md)). The new ExciseStampOperation is created as follows:

```
ExciseStampOperationLine.LineNo = Autonumber

ExciseStampOperationLine.ParentLineNo = StoreTransactionLine.LineNo

ExciseStampOperationLine.ParentDocument = StoreTransactionLine.TransactionObj

ExciseStampOperationLine.Product = StoreTransactionLine.Product

ExciseStampOperationLine.Quantity = StoreTransactionLine.REMAINING(MQuantity)

ExciseStampOperationLineLine.ExciseProductType = StoreTransactionLine.Product.ExciseProductType


```
