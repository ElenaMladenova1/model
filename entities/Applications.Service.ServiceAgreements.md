The process of changing the document state is very labor intensive and includes              validation, generation of sub-documents and some other document-specific tasks.                          The state changing process might be very time-consuming, usually ranging              from 500 to 5000 milliseconds.                          Document states usually can only be advanced to higher states, but there are              exceptions from this rule. Database settings and configuration options might affect             the allowed state changes.                          Numerous kinds of document-specific and generic exceptions can be thrown during the             process.

    | WithAllChildren | The document, along with is sub-documents, will be completed <br /> _Model Value:_ 1 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'WithAllChildren' |
    | WithReleasedChildren | The document, along with its Release-ed sub-documents, will be completed <br /> _Model Value:_ 2 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'WithReleasedChildren' |



The process of changing the document state is very labor intensive and includes              validation, generation of sub-documents and some other document-specific tasks.                          The state changing process might be very time-consuming, usually ranging              from 500 to 5000 milliseconds.                          Document states usually can only be advanced to higher states, but there are              exceptions from this rule. Database settings and configuration options might affect             the allowed state changes.                          Numerous kinds of document-specific and generic exceptions can be thrown during the             process.

### MakeVoid

_Declaring Type_: **[Documents](General.Documents.md)**  
_Domain API Request_: **POST**  

**Parameters**  
  * **reason**  
    The reason for voiding the document.  
    _Type_: string  

  * **voidType**  
    The type of void operation to execute.  
    _Type_: General.DocumentsRepositoryBase.VoidType  
    Specifies the type of void operation  
    _Allowed Values (General.DocumentsRepositoryBase.VoidType Enum Members)_  

    | Value | Description |
    | ---- | --- |
    | VoidDocument | Void only the document. If there are sub-documents, the operation might fail. <br /> _Model Value:_ 0 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'VoidDocument' |
    | VoidWithSubDocuments | Void the document and its non-released sub-documents. If there are released sub-documents, the operation might fail. <br /> _Model Value:_ 1 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'VoidWithSubDocuments' |
    | VoidWithReleased<br />SubDocuments | Void the document and all of its sub-documents, even the released ones. <br /> _Model Value:_ 2 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'VoidWithReleased<br />SubDocuments' |

     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: VoidDocument  


### GetPrintout

Gets a document printout as a file. The returned value is Base64 string representation of the file contents.  
_Return Type_: **string**  
_Declaring Type_: **[Documents](General.Documents.md)**  
_Domain API Request_: **POST**  

**Parameters**  
  * **fileFormat**  
    The file format: pdf, html, xlsx, xls, docx, txt and png. The default format is 'pdf'.  
    _Type_: string  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: pdf  

  * **printout**  
    The printout defined for the document type of the document. If null the default printout of the document type is used.  
    _Type_: [Printouts](General.Printouts.md)  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: null  


### Recalculate

The document and all of its owned objects will be altered to become valid.  
_Return Type_: **void**  
_Declaring Type_: **[Documents](General.Documents.md)**  
_Domain API Request_: **POST**  

In some cases the objects in child collection of the document depend on values from other child objects.             This method ensures that all child objects are properly validated.             The changes are only in memory and are not committed to the server.
